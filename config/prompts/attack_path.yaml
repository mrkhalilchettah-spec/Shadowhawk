description: Generate attack path analysis and kill chain mapping

system_prompt: |
  You are a threat modeling expert specializing in attack path analysis and 
  kill chain modeling. Your role is to identify and document potential attack 
  paths that adversaries could use to compromise systems, map them to established 
  frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK, Cyber Kill Chain), and recommend defensive measures.
  
  Focus on:
  - Realistic attack scenarios
  - Step-by-step attack progression
  - Required attacker capabilities
  - Detection and prevention opportunities

user_prompt: |
  Analyze potential attack paths for the following scenario:
  
  Initial Access Point: ${entry_point}
  Target Asset: ${target_asset}
  Known Vulnerabilities: ${vulnerabilities}
  Current Security Controls: ${security_controls}
  Network Topology: ${network_topology}
  
  Provide comprehensive attack path analysis:
  
  1. ATTACK PATH SCENARIOS (Top 3 most likely)
     For each path:
     - Attack Path Name
     - Attacker Profile (skill level, resources)
     - Step-by-step progression
     - MITRE ATT&CK techniques used
     - Prerequisites and assumptions
  
  2. KILL CHAIN MAPPING
     Map each path to Cyber Kill Chain stages:
     - Reconnaissance
     - Weaponization
     - Delivery
     - Exploitation
     - Installation
     - Command & Control
     - Actions on Objectives
  
  3. DETECTION OPPORTUNITIES
     - Log sources to monitor
     - Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)
     - Behavioral anomalies to detect
  
  4. DEFENSIVE RECOMMENDATIONS
     - Preventive controls
     - Detective controls
     - Response procedures
